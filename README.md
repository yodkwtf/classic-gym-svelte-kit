# Classic Gym - Svelte Kit Landing Page

This is a landing page for my gym, Classic Gym. It is built using Svelte Kit and Tailwind CSS. This was meant to be a simple project to get me started with Svelte Kit and Tailwind CSS. It has a very cool and modern design and is fully responsive. It is also SEO friendly and has a very good performance. The design is my own and I used my gym's theme colors.
